# Introducing "Peanut" for Wordpress

Build your themes and blocks with component-like elements!

Peanut For Wordpress, is an application (and maybe it's a lightweight framework?) built to help with the development process of creating plugins, themes, and blocks. Similar to Wordpress scripts package, it’ll compile all the client side code you need for your blocks and plugins. It will also give you the ability to create reusable “components” within your themes and blocks.

### Components?

Peanut was built to help create "components" within your WordPress site that could be easily used in multiple ways. It extends WordPress' Template Parts functionality in order to encapsulate all the code for a component into one area. These modular components can then be easily customized via argument "props" and reused across different elements (i.e. WordPress blocks and themes).

In a nutshell (pun intended), the goal is to empower you to save time while building all the things you love in WordPress.

For more of an introduction to this project, you can [read our evolving online blog post](https://www.sassywackypeanut.com/introducing-peanut-for-wordpress/).

## Getting Started

Peanut For Wordpress requires a local development environment running both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) and, of course, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/about/).

### NPM Install

To install in your node project, you can run:

```bash
npm i @swplabs/peanutforwp --save-dev
```

Alternatively, you can install globally using the following command:

```
npm i @swplabs/peanutforwp -g
```

**Note**: Installing globally will allow you to run the "peanut" cli command anywhere. This is helpful when you have multiple projects with different source directories.

### Clone the GitHub repo

You can download the full source from our public GitHub repo using this link or go to our GitHub repo homepage for cloning instructions similiar to this:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:swplabs/peanut.git
